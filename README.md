## Project Plan

### Goal

The goal of this data science project is to analyze Sephora's product data to identify trends and insights that can inform purchasing decisions.
There are a few repos on Github with in-depth analyses of product ratings and reviews on Sephora's website.

This project focuses on comparing product value across brand and product type, with the potential to cluster products into categories.
Products with value or travel-size options will be compared - inspired by this tiktok _______

### Data Collection
The first step will be to collect product data from Sephora's website and other relevant sources. 

- Data on products and pricing will be gathered using Python, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup.
- Size and structure of data collected will determine if it's best to use basic files or something like an SQLite DB.

### Data Cleaning

- I am anticipating that the volume data for each product will be tricky to clean. Possibly the Pint Python library will be helpful when parsing units from volumnes.
