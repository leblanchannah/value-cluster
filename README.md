[Sephora Value Canvas Dashboard](https://leblanchannah.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Overview

Welcome to the Sephora Product Price Comparison Dashboard! This project was created as part of the Data Visualization Society Mentorship Program and serves as a comprehensive tool for analyzing and comparing product prices at Sephora, a popular cosmetics and beauty store. In addition to visualizing product prices, this project includes a Python and Selenium web scraper to extract data from the Sephora website and a Python data science pipeline to clean and process the data.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to help users make informed purchasing decisions by providing insights into product unit prices. Sephora offers products in various sizes, and the unit prices can vary significantly. This dashboard not only compares the prices of different products but also highlights cost-effective options by identifying products with lower unit prices.

This project was inspired by the ["Sephora Minis Math"](https://www.tiktok.com/@michaelamakeup92/video/7237211338618047787") TikTok by @michaelamakeup92
