## Project Plan

### Goal

Identify trends and insights that can inform purchasing decisions in Sephora's product data.
There are a few repos on Github with in-depth analyses of product ratings and reviews on Sephora's website.
- https://github.com/rendy-m/Sephora-Data-Mining
- https://github.com/Shirleyiscool/Scraping-Sephora
This project focuses on comparing product value across brand and product type.
Products with value or travel-size options will be compared - inspired by this tiktok _______

### Data Collection
The first step will be to collect product data from Sephora's website and other relevant sources. 

- Products and pricing data will be gathered using Python, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup.
- Size and structure of data collected will determine data storage used.

### Data Cleaning

- I am anticipating that the volume data for each product will be tricky to clean because of differences in units for liquids and solids.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

### Modeling

### Visualizations and Dashboard 

### Communication
